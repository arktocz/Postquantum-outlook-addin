# Adition of polifills
- some used modules are not suited for browser environment, so these polifills function as fallbacks:
- crypto-browserify
- vm-browserify
- stream-browserify
- instalation:
    -npm install crypto-browserify vm-browserify stream-browserify
- editation of module.exports in webpack.config.js:
    ```
    resolve: {
      extensions: [".html", ".js"],
      fallback: {
        crypto: require.resolve("crypto-browserify"),
        vm: require.resolve("vm-browserify"),
        stream: require.resolve("stream-browserify"),
      }
    }
    ```

# Editation of taskpane.html and taskpane.js
- those files are responsible for basic looks and functionality of the addin
